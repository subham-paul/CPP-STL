# CPP-STL

The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful collection of reusable algorithms, containers, and iterators designed to increase the efficiency and flexibility of C++ programs. This Github repo provides a concise overview of the STL, including explanations and examples of the most commonly used containers (such as vectors, lists, and maps), algorithms (such as sorting and searching), and iterators (such as input and output iterators). Additionally, the repo includes tips and tricks for optimizing STL code and using more advanced features, such as function objects and templates. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced C++ programmer, this repo is a valuable resource for mastering the STL and writing efficient, elegant code.
