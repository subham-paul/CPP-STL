# CPP-STL

The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful collection of reusable algorithms, containers, and iterators designed to increase the efficiency and flexibility of C++ programs. This Github repo provides a concise overview of the STL, including explanations and examples of the most commonly used containers (such as vectors, lists, and maps), algorithms (such as sorting and searching), and iterators (such as input and output iterators).
